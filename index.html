      <h1><u>The Monty Hall Problem</u></h1>
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">The Monty Hall Problem</a> is a well known conundrum based on probability</p>
      <p>A gameshow contestant is given a choice of 3 doors.  Behind 1 is a car, and behind the other 2 are goats.
          When the contestant has chosen a door, the game show host will open one of the other doors which will always have a goat behind it.
      </p>
      <p>The contestant is given the option to stick with their chosen door or switch to the remaining unopened door.</p>

      <p>The aim of this challenge is to prove Vos Savant's findings that statistically, the best option is always to switch doors.</p>
